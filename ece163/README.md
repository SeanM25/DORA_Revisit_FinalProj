# D.O.R.A. Flight Dynamics Modeling

## Project Context and Objectives
This project builds upon the previous work done on the D.O.R.A. project. Our primary objective is to model the dynamics of the D.O.R.A. vehicle using AVL (Athena Vortex Lattice) software. The resulting model will be integrated into the ECE263 flight simulator, enabling it to be used as a teaching tool for future courses. Additionally, we aim to animate the control surfaces within the simulator to enhance its visual and functional realism.

## Installation and Setup
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
   Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of the repository.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   ```sh
   cd <repository_folder>
   ```
   Replace `<repository_folder>` with the name of the cloned repository folder.

3. **Ensure Python is Installed**
   This project requires Python. If you haven't installed Python, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/) and ensure it is added to your system's PATH.

## Running the Script
Once inside the project folder, run the following command:

```sh
python .\Chapter4.py
```

This will execute the script and integrate the vehicle dynamics into the flight simulator.

## Using the Simulator
After running the script:
1. Click **Start Sim** in the simulation interface.
2. Adjust the sliders to see the control surfaces animate and move.
3. Observe how the control inputs affect the vehicle's dynamics in real-time.

## Dependencies
Ensure that all necessary dependencies are installed. If required, install them using:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Contribution Guidelines
- If you make changes, ensure you create a new branch before submitting a pull request.
- Follow proper coding conventions and document your code where necessary.
- Test your modifications before pushing them.

## Contact
For any issues or questions, please reach out to the project maintainers or open an issue in the repository.
